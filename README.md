# Profile-Projects
Hi there! I'm Nur Attiq, a Data Analyst with a taste for insights. 
On this page you'll find some projects I did as a first-time programmer during my Masters of Science in Business Analytics. I learned a lot during and after my degree, and thought it would be fun to put some of my favourite projects in one place! My appraoch in programming is to keep it simple, organised, and get the job done. 
Among the 3 languages I'm fluent in; python, R, SQL, you'll find most of these projects use python (favouritism right there). I've found python to be the most user friendly language with an abundance of complex and intricate libraries. 
This was just the start of my journey to programming, I'm learning more every day and can't wait to share my personal projects in the future. 
Anyway, enjoy!
